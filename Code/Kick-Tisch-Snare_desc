* Kick Tisch Snare Description

This code is a simple program for an AVR microcontroller that controls three LEDs (white, blue, and red) to create a basic drum pattern. The LEDs represent different percussion instruments, and the code cycles through a pattern simulating a drum rhythm.

Hardware Setup
The code assumes that the LEDs are connected to specific pins on the AVR microcontroller. Here's the setup:

White LED (Hi-hat 1): Connected to pin PB2.
Blue LED (Kick): Connected to pin PB3.
Red LED (Snare): Connected to pin PB1.
Make sure to connect the LEDs to the correct pins on your microcontroller to see the intended drum pattern.

Drum Pattern
The code follows a drum pattern with a tempo of 128 beats per minute (BPM). Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

Hi-hat 1 (white LED - PB2) blinks before the kick.
Kick (blue LED - PB3) blinks on every first beat.
Hi-hat 2 (white LED - PB2) blinks between the kick and snare.
Snare (red LED - PB1) blinks on every second beat.
Hi-hat 3 (white LED - PB2) blinks after the snare.
The code uses _delay_ms to control the timing of LED blinking to match the 128 BPM tempo.

How to Use
Ensure your AVR microcontroller is properly connected to the LEDs as described above.
Compile and flash this code onto your microcontroller.
The LEDs will light up and follow the described drum pattern, creating a basic drum rhythm.
Feel free to modify the code, adjust the timing, or add more LEDs to create your own unique drum patterns using this as a starting point.
